## Overview

**Numenigma** is a project designed to automatically generate complete math riddles â€“ each featuring both a challenging question and its corresponding answer. The project is divided into three main phases:

1. **Dataset Creation:** We prepared a CSV dataset containing 50 unique math riddles.
2. **Model Fine-Tuning:** We fine-tuned the lightweight TinyLlama model using PyTorch and the Hugging Face Transformers library.
3. **Interactive Testing:** A user-friendly Streamlit interface allows you to generate and test new math riddles on the fly.

## Why TinyLlama?

TinyLlama is chosen for its balance of efficiency and performance:
- **Lightweight & Fast:** Suitable for low-resource environments and rapid experimentation.
- **Efficient Fine-Tuning:** Its smaller architecture allows for quick fine-tuning on custom datasets.
- **Transformer-based:** Uses self-attention mechanisms to generate coherent and creative text.

### How It Works

TinyLlama processes text by converting words into embeddings, applying self-attention across multiple layers, and then generating output tokens based on learned patterns. When fine-tuned on our math riddle dataset, it learns the structure and style needed to craft both the riddle and its answer.

## Project Structure

```
Numenigma/
â”œâ”€â”€ Numenigma.ipynb       # Notebook File
â”œâ”€â”€ riddlesfactory.csv    # CSV file with 50 math riddles (Riddle column and Answer column)     
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                # Streamlit interface for interactive riddle generation
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # This file
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/buzzgrewal/numenigma.git
   cd numenigma
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Example content for `requirements.txt`:*
   ```txt
   torch
   transformers
   pandas
   streamlit
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset is stored in `riddlefactory.csv` and should have the following format:

```csv
Riddle,Answer
"What number becomes zero when you subtract 15 from half of it?",30
...
```

Each entry contains a math riddle along with its answer. During fine-tuning, the riddle is formatted into a prompt (e.g., `"Riddle: <riddle_text>"`) that the model uses to learn the complete structure.

## Fine-Tuning

To fine-tune TinyLlama on our custom dataset, use the  `Numenigma.ipynb` file:



### Key Points:
- **Dataset Splitting:** The script splits the data into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjust learning rate, weight decay, warmup steps, and other parameters for optimal performance.
- **Randomization:** Training data is shuffled each epoch to maximize learning on our small dataset.

## Streamlit Interface

For an interactive experience, run the Streamlit interface:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Features:
- **Custom Prompt:** Enter your own prompt (e.g., "Generate a math riddle:") to guide the model.
- **Adjustable Parameters:** Modify `max_new_tokens`, `top_k`, and `top_p` to influence generation length and diversity.
- **Real-Time Generation:** View the generated math riddle instantly on the web interface.
